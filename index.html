        The goal is to move fast together while building something great. This blueprint to make my working style transparent so we can focus on shipping instead of figuring each other out.

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
        

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I follow the delete → simplify → accelerate → automate sequence</div>
            <div class="details">First delete what you can (if you don't add back 10%, you didn't delete enough), then simplify what's left, then speed it up, then automate only what truly adds value.</div>
        </div> 

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I always question requirements before touching code</div>
            <div class="details">Most engineering failures come from optimizing the wrong thing. I always ask: Who made this requirement and why? Can we delete it? The most dangerous requirements are the ones we don't question.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I use Double Diamond for complex problems</div>
            <div class="details"><em>Discover</em> the real problem by rooting out assumptions. <em>Define</em> it clearly. Then brainstorm and <em>Develop</em> multiple solutions to <em>Deliver</em> the right thing. Skipping Discovery and Development of ideas means doing the wrong thing.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>How I Communicate</h3>
        
        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">Communicate to decide and act</div>
            <div class="details">Every communication needs to move us closer to taking action. Docs are usually not the best for this. Conversations and whiteboarding is better. Docs help refine thinking but then let's talk through it.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">You cannot be too direct with me</div>
            <div class="details">I'm allergic to sugar-coating. Be brutally honest - blunt feedback over diplomatic language. I strive to keep trust batteries charged so we can sacrifice tact for honesty and directness.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I need to understand what you want</div>
            <div class="details">If I know what's important to you, I'll move mountains to help you get it. If I don't know, I can't help effectively. Be explicit about your goals and what success looks like for you.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Decision Making</h3>
        
        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">Make decisions at the edges, break ties at the top</div>
            <div class="details">I believe people closest to the problem, deepest into the details, should be the ones making decisions. I  own all your decisions - blame is mine, credit is yours. So I may override (rarely) if I have context you're missing, or if my experience has taught me a better way. </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I have strong opinions, loosely held</div>
            <div class="details">I'm confident in my positions but my mind changes instantly with credible counter-evidence. Challenge my thinking - I welcome it. Come with strong opinions based on your research.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I decide very quickly</div>
            <div class="details">When deciding, I sacrifice "perfect" for "good enough." Bad decisions can be fixed with future choices. I use data to inform decisions but don't obsess over data or metrics. A lot of important factors aren't measured.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Key Quirks</h3>
        
        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I ramp slower but master faster</div>
            <div class="details">It annoys my family that I am terrible at a new board game the first 10 times, then suddenly never lose. At work, I may take longer than expected to get started and get my bearings, but then become unstoppable much faster. Please be patient during my ramp period.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">I will always find a way</div>
            <div class="details">No problem is unsolvable, though solutions may require creativity. I'm solution-oriented and will help you find a way through any obstacle. Don't struggle in silence.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>What I Expect From My Teammates</h3>
        
        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">Come with researched opinions, not just questions</div>
            <div class="details">Be prepared to defend your thinking with context about what you've tried and what you're thinking. Don't just bring problems - bring your analysis and potential solutions.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">Focus on what matters, let other fires burn</div>
            <div class="details">It's better to let some things slide while focusing on what's truly important. If I feel we're working on something that's a waste of time, I will let you know immediately. Please do the same.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="bullet-item">
            <div class="headline">Truth-seeking</div>
            <div class="details">I care very deeply that we see the world as it is and act on the truth. That means debate and discussion to understand what's real, what's not and what's biased so we make the best decisions. Some people find this frustrating, but it can be very fast with practice.</div>
